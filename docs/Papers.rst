Studies using OpenWPM 
======================

Data collected by WebTAP
------------------------

Since 2015, WebTAP has conducted a web census to study third-party online tracking.
Each month between 2015-2018, they visited the web’s 1 million most popular sites using
OpenWPM and record data pertaining
to user privacy, including cookies, fingerprinting scripts, the effect of browser privacy tools,
and the exchange of tracking data between different sites (“cookie syncing”).

WebTAP has `released <https://webtransparency.cs.princeton.edu/webcensus/data-release/>`_
the entire Princeton Web Census data — about 15 terabytes — containing
privacy measurements of 1 million sites conducted each month from December 2015 to June 2018.
