# TaskManager

## Overview

The user-facing component of the OpenWPM platform is the Task Manager. The Task Manager oversees multiple browser instances and passes them commands. The Task Manager also ensures that crawls continue despite browser crashes for freezes. In particular, it checks whether a given browser fails to complete a command within a given timeout (or has died) and kills/restarts this browser as necessary.

## Instantiating a Task Manager

All automation code is contained within the `automation` folder; the Task Manager code is contained in `automation/TaskManager.py`.

Task Managers can be instantiated in the following way:

`manager = TaskManager.TaskManager(manager_params, browser_params)`

You can call
```python
manager_params, browser_params = TaskManager.load_default_params(number_of_browsers_to_spawn)
```
to get the default parameters.

To learn more about the `manager_params` and `browser_params` have a look at [Configuration.md](Configuration.md)

`<process_watchdog>` is an optional parameter that can be passed to the `TaskManager` to create another thread that kills off all processes named `Xvfb` or `firefox` that haven't been spawned by OpenWPM.

## Issuing commands

OpenWPM uses the `CommandSequence` as a fundamental unit of work.
A `CommandSequence` describes as series of steps that will execute in order on a particular Browser.
All available Commands are visible by inspecting the `CommandSequence` API.

For example you could wire up a `CommandSequence` to go to a given url and take a screenshot of it by writing:
```python
    command_sequence = CommandSequence(url)
    # Start by visiting the page
    command_sequence.get(sleep=3, timeout=60)
    command_sequence.save_screenshot()
```

But this on it's own would do nothing, because `CommandSequence`s are not automatically scheduled.
Instead you need to submit them to a `TaskManager` by calling:
```python
    manager.execute_command_sequence(command_sequence)
    manager.close()
```

Please note that you need to close the manager, because by default CommandSequences are executed in a non-blocking fashion meaning that you might reach the end of you main function/file before the CommandSequence completed running.

`TaskManager.execute_command_sequence` has an optional `index` parameter that enables the user to specify which of the existing browsers should execute a command. The options are

* `None`: the command is executed by a browser on a first-come, first-serve basis
* `<index>`: the command is executed by the `<index>`th browser instance

## Adding new commands

Currently the easiest way to execute a user defined function as part of a CommandSequence is to use the
`run_custom_function` method on the CommandSequence, however we hope to significantly improve this process
with https://github.com/mozilla/OpenWPM/issues/743.

# Browser Manager

## Overview

Contained in `automation/BrowserManager.py`, Browser Managers provide a wrapper around the drivers used to automate full browser instances. In particular, we opted to use [Selenium](http://docs.seleniumhq.org/) to drive full browser instances as bot detection frameworks can more easily detect lightweight alternatives such as PhantomJS. 

Browser Managers receive commands from the Task Manager, which they then pass to the command executor (located in `automation/Commands/command_executor.py`), which receives a command object and converts it into web driver actions. Browser Managers also receive browser parameters which they use to instantiate the Selenium web driver using one of the browser initialization functions contained in `automation/DeployBrowsers`.

The Browser class, contained in the same file, is the Task Manager's wrapper around Browser Managers, which allow it to cleanly kill and restart Browser Managers as necessary.

**Important Programming Note** The Browser Managers are designed to isolate the Task Manager from the underlying browser instances. As part of this approach, no data from the browsers should flow up to the Task Manager (beyond basic metadata such as the browsers' process IDs). For instance, if the Browser Manager is assigned the task of collecting and parsing XPath data, this parsing should be completed by Browser Managers and **not** passed up to the Task Manager for post-processing.

## Browser Information Logging

Throughout the course of a measurement, the Browser Managers' commands (along with timestamps and the status of the commands) are logged by the Task Manager, which contributes the the reproducibility of individual experiments. The data are sent to the Data Aggregator process, which provides stability in logging data despite the possibility of individual browser crashes.

# The WebExtension

All of our data collection happens in the OpenWPM WebExtension, which can be found under [automation/Extension](../automation/Extension).
The Extension makes heavy use of priviliged APIs and can only be installed on unbranded or custom builds of Firefox with add-on security disabled.

The currently supported instruments can be found in [Configuration.md](Configuration.md#Instruments)


# Data Aggregator

## Overview

One of the Data Aggregators, contained in `automation/DataAggregator`, gets spawned in a separate process and receives data from the WebExtension and the platform alike. We as previously mentioned we support both local as well as remote data saving.
The most useful feature of the Data Aggregator is the fact that it is isolated from the other processes through a network socket interface (see `automation/SocketInterface.py`).

## Data Logged

The full schema for the platform's output is contained in the [schema documentation](Schema-Documentation.md)
