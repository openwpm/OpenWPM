# Release Checklist

We aim to release a new version of OpenWPM with each new Firefox release (~1 release per month). The following steps are necessary for a release:

1. Upgrade Firefox to the newest version.
    1. Go to: https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-release/tags.
    2. Find the commit hash for the Firefox release version you'd like to upgrade to.
    3. Update the `TAG` variable in [`scripts/install-firefox.sh`](../scripts/install-firefox.sh#L12) to that hash and the comment to the new tag name.
2. Update extension dependencies.
    1. Run `npm update` in `openwpm/Extension/firefox`.
    2. Run `npm update` in `openwpm/Extension/webext-instrumentation`.
    3. Run `npm update` in the base directory
3. Update python and system dependencies by following the ["managing requirements" instructions](../CONTRIBUTING.md#managing-requirements).
4. If a new version of geckodriver is used, check whether the default geckodriver browser preferences in [`openwpm/deploy_browsers/configure_firefox.py`](../openwpm/deploy_browsers/configure_firefox.py#L8L65) need to be updated.
5. Increment the version number in [VERSION](../VERSION)
6. Add a summary of changes since the last version to [CHANGELOG](../CHANGELOG.md)
7. Squash and merge the release PR to master.
8. Publish a new release from https://github.com/mozilla/OpenWPM/releases:
    1. Click "Draft a new release".
    2. Enter the "Tag version" and "Release title" as `vX.X.X`.
    3. In the description:
        1. Include the text `Updates OpenWPM to Firefox X` if this release is also a new FF version.
        2. Include a link to the CHANGELOG, e.g. `See the [CHANGELOG]() for details.`.
