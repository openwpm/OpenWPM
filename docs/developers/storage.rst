There are a couple of central concepts around the topic of storing data in OpenWPM

Unstructured Data
    Data which is of unknown structure. Usually referring to captured Web content, e.g. JS or HTML.

Structured Data
    Data which is recorded by the WebExtension or emitted by the platform. Mostly tabular in nature.

    See Schema-Documentation.md for all currently defined Structured Data.
