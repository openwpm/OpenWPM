    """ Finds cookie-notice/cookie-wall banners on an HTML page using CSS selectors. The
    selectors are collected by the browser extension "I don't care about cookies".

    Args:
        page_url: URL of the webpage, used to add domain-specific selectors
        page_html: HTML of the webpage
        banner_list_loc: location of selector file (ABP filter-list style)
        logger: optional paramter to report progress; if None, stdout is used
    Returns:
        Tuple: (number of selectors, list of banner elements)
        The banners are in a named tuple (selector, element-tag, element-id, banner-text)

    Notes:
        Since the selectors are collected using crowd-sourcing, and thus might miss sites.
        There are additional false-negatives and false-positive problems as well, but the
        overall  accuracy is high for well-known sites (>90%).

        The false-negatives are caused by banners created using javascript redirects, which
        the extension detects, but are not in their ABP filter list (e.g. see dumpert.nl).
        The false-positives are multiple matches (e.g. nu.nl) or matches to invisible elements
        (e.g. faz.net).

        The speed of this function varies based on the passed HTML -- from a few seconds to
        almost a minute.
