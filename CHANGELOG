v0.10.0 - under development
=======

Changes:
  * Migrate to WebExtensions from the addon-sdk.

v0.9.0 - 2019-04-15
======

A checkpoint release for the final version of OpenWPM to support Firefox 52
and the addon-sdk framework. We recommend against using this release as Firefox
52ESR is no longer receiving security updates.

Changes:
  * The `automation` library can now be used with Python 3.4 or later,
    as well as Python 2.7.
  * Bump to Firefox 52 ESR, Selenium 3.4.0+, and geckodriver 0.15.0.
    * geckodriver is required for Selenium 3+. `install.sh` will download
      and install it.
    * geckodriver 0.16.0+ does not support Firefox 52 or lower, so we are
      stuck with 0.15.0 (and any bugs it may have) until the next ESR release.
    * These versions of geckodriver and Selenium require Firefox 48+.
  * MITMProxy support has been removed.  Use `http_instrument` instead.
  * Bundled Firefox privacy extensions have been updated.
    * AdBlock Plus support has been removed.
    * uBlock Origin and Disconnect added.
    * Ghostery has been updated.
  * Extensions built using the WebExtensions API are now supported. Our
    extension still uses the add-on sdk.
  * Experimental support for saving Parquet files on S3
  * Numerous bug fixes
